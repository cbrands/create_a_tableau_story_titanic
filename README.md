# Create a tableau story titanic
## Summary
Titanic was a british passenger liner that sank on April 15 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. This dissaster cost the lives of 1522 people.

This story will first give an demographic overview of the population of Titanic passengers. Next we will look into the factors that influence the survival percentage.

## Design
This story contains 5 slides. The first slide is about the demographic nature of the Titanic population, the other slides are about factor influencing the survival rate.

I worked mostly with bar charts with filters on the right side of the graph this way the user can easely click on the filters to zoom in on what interrests him/her most.

There are two exceptions.
First on the graph "What about the children?" I did not use a filter for male / female but instead showed separate bar charts for male and female. This I did to quickly showed the main point that the higher survival rate for children was only true for boys.

The second exception is on the first sheet. Here I showed the relatives on board as a bubble chart. I did this as the number of people with no relatives on board dwarved the other groups. If I used a bar chart the difference between 4, 5, and 6 relativves would be hardly vissible.

## Feedback
I received feedback from Yan Zhu. This feedback is saved in feedback-Yan.txt.
Based on the feedback I made the following changes
* Clarified: class = economic status
* Made the headers more attractive

Aside of the feedback changes I also consolidated all the sheets related to the demographic population of the Titanic to one dashboard. This story is about survival and having three sheets on demography of the Titanic distracted to much.
