i've taken a look at it
i think your work is fine if you're doing exploratory analysis
however, i think the task is something more "showy"
i do need to preface this with that i learnt tableau by reading stuff done by people generally regarded as experts
so my comments will be pretty harsh
i tend to prefer visualisations that have a flow and a story
something like this

for your chosen dataset, i might do something like come up with a slightly ludicrous (but somewhat truthful header), like
want to survive the titanic? be a rich woman (i recall that the location of boarding actually encodes for wealth)
i would suggest looking up the past iron viz winners for inspiration
